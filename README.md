# Bob's Burgers
This app focuses on combining Node, with Handlebars/Express to server up burgers. 
It also uses an ORM to help with the communication with the database.




1. The burgers can be requested via Linda.

2. Linda has Bob make the burger. 

3. Louise keeps track of each burger she eats!

## Handlebars handles some of the display while MySQL is used to actually store the burgers that are made and eaten.
